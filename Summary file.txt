The Code3.R, Data1-FDis.csv, Data2-effect.csv and Data3-correlation.csv are used in supporting the study titled "Multiple nutrient additions homogenize multi-dimensional plant stoichiometry in a meadow steppe". The Code3.R is written in R. The CSV files are data for figures and tables. Open the Code3.R, run the codes by using the data from the three CSV files.
In the Data1-FDis.csv, the 315 rows represent data records for 105 plots in each of the 3 years. The "year" represent the specific calendar year; the "duration" represent the experimental duration of nutrient additions; the "NAR" represent the number of added resources; the "block" represent the identity of block; the "treat" represent the treatment ID; the "FDis" represent the stoichiometric (functional) divergence of the plant communities without unit.
In the Data2-effect.csv and Data3-correlation.csv,  the 8 rows represent data records for 8 kinds of nutrient factors. The "ratio" and "se" represent the the relative ratios of effects of nutrient addition on the corresponding available contents in soil, and their stardard errors. The "Ratio" and "Se" represent the the relative ratios of effects of nutrient addition on the corresponding available contents in plant issues, and their stardard errors.
